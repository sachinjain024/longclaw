## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues use LongClaw local Markdown under `.longclaw/tickets/<KEY>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical triage roles map to LongClaw label slugs. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repository. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Token discipline

- Prefer `rg` and targeted file ranges over broad file dumps.
- Do not inspect generated, cache, build, or dependency directories unless explicitly needed.
- Avoid sub-agents unless the user requests parallel review or the task truly benefits from it.
- Keep command output capped and summarize large results.
- For reviews, inspect the diff first before reading surrounding files.
